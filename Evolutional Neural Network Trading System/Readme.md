# Evolutional Neural Network Trading System

After each one of them is run, they're selected whether or not to proceed in the next generation based on
their performance.

You can request the data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0F0rojmsYn2b1BHLV9MaERjY1k?usp=sharing)
I'll provide access asap.
